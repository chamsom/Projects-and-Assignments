These two arrays are not equal because they are stored in different places in memory.

int[] a = {1, 2, 3};

int[] b = {1, 2, 3};

This does not print anything, since they are in two different places.

if (a == b) {
	System.out.println("they are equal!");
}

Whenever you need to iterate over an array and print what's inside. Use these two for loops.

int[] a = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++)
	System.out.println(a[i]);

foreach (int element : a)	
	System.out.println(element);
