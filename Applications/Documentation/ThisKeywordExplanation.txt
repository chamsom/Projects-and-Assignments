Java creates a default constructor for you. A constructor is another type of method.
It has the same name as the class.

public Pet2(String name) {

	System.out.println(name);
	...
}

public Pet2(String name) {

	System.out.println(this.name); "this" refers to the class attribute "private String name;".
	...
}

public Pet2(String name) {

	this.name = name; Whatever parameters passed through "name" is now assigned to the class attribute by "this.name". 
}
